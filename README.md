This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Hello BB 
Hello BB was the technical capstone project during my time at the Flatiron School Software Engineering Immersive program. 

It is a digital scrapbook for new parents to document their young child's earliest memories and milestones and conceptually meant to be shared with their child once they are older. I built this project Using React JS and Redux, with Rails on the backend.

You can find a full video demo (with audio) where I describe some of the main functionality here: [YouTube link](https://youtu.be/dP6O4kVQpGo)

You can view the backend repo here: [backend](https://github.com/sabby155/hello-bb-backend)
